## The Genomics Platform Group: About

We are building up a Genomics Platform Team to develop, test and apply accredited bioinformatics workflows to patient data and large scale research projects, evaluating new technologies at a rapid pace. 

## The Centre for Cancer Research

The [University of Melbourne Centre for Cancer Research](https://research.unimelb.edu.au/centre-for-cancer-research/home) (UMCCR), led by Professor [Sean Grimmond](https://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person773948), has the mission to improve cancer patient outcome through genome discovery, translation and personalised medicine. It seeks to achieve this by advancing the molecular detection & diagnosis of cancer, prioritising therapeutic selection via Computational Oncology, and enabling programs in personalised cancer care.

Spanning more than 5000 square meters the UMCCR provides specialist laboratories for cancer cell biology, DNA biobanking, rapid large scale, HTS sequencing and organoid generation and testing. Once fully occupied, the Centre is expected to house more than 260 researchers. It is part of the [Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre](https://www.viccompcancerctr.org/) located in the [Melbourne Biomedical Precinct](https://www.melbournebiomed.com), an environment for more than 25 health services, academic research institutes and startups. The Centre has recently announced a [partnership with Illumina](https://about.unimelb.edu.au/newsroom/news/2019/february/illumina-partnership-to-drive-genomics-innovation-in-australia) to accelerate genomics innovation in cancer research.

## Opportunities

As part of the team you will work with national and international partners to avoid re-inventing the wheel. Here are just some of your opportunities:

* help us migrate our data management capabilities to Amazon Web Services
* work with us porting [bcbio-nextgen](https://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), our HTS workflow system, to the [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org/)
* collaborate with our collaborators at Illumina, The Broad Institute and across the Global Alliance for Genomics & Health (GA4GH) to define, implement and test [data processing and dissemination methods](https://github.com/ga4gh/wiki/wiki)
* coordinate with the European Bioinformatics Institute and the GA4GH's [Large Scale Genomics' team](https://github.com/ga4gh/large-scale-genomics-wiki/wiki) on the development of [Local EGA](https://localega.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* improve our whole genome and transcriptome workflows 

The Centre has established a Genomics Innovation Hub, a Melbourne Medical Precinct-wide initiative, which partners with leaders in the genomic technology industry to rapidly develop and deploy disruptive molecular profiling technologies best suited to decoding cancer samples for our local research community. We are exploring the use of linked reads such as [10X / Chromium](https://www.10xgenomics.com/) to improve structural variation detection, explore single-cell technologies to study tumour evolution, and assess long-read technologies to investigate tumour samples without a clear driver event. Exploring how to best apply long read technologies is next on the list, courtesy of a local [Promethion](https://www.bioplatforms.com/australian-genome-research-facility-ltd/). 

## Work with us

All positions that we offer are funded for three years and offer 17% superannuation. Working hours are flexible, and remote or part-time work can be negotiated. The University is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status.

If you are passionate about open source software development and establishing a genomics platform to change cancer patient care you should apply. Your responsibilities are flexible and depend on both your interests and expertise. You will be involved in rapid whole genome and transcriptome sequencing of cancer patients and we can offer a fantastic work environment.
