We have a new opening for a [Bioinformatician](http://jobs.unimelb.edu.au/caw/en/job/899782/bioinformatician-genomic-medicine) , Genomic Medicine (PSC 8 - $103,409 -$111,927 p.a.).

## What would I be doing?

We are looking for a bioinformatician who will provide vital support to the [UoM Clinical Genomics Platform](https://research.unimelb.edu.au/centre-for-cancer-research/engage/services#clinical-genomics-platform): assisting with the flow of data through our systems, providing quality control assessments of sequencing data and helping to troubleshoot bottlenecks. You would help drive our ongoing WGS/WTS accreditation effort and be responsible for managing, analysing and interpreting genomic data for accreditation, with corresponding documentation, and assess the [DRAGEN environment](https://www.illumina.com/company/news-center/press-releases/2018/2349147.html) using both HPC and cloud computing to improve our clinical reports. If you are interested in exploring large scale genomic data sets in a clinical setting (see [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/623702v1) or [this poster](https://www.nygenome.org/bioinformatics/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOG-poster-20194.pdf) for typical examples) this might be the role for you. You will also have the opportunity to work with commercial partners at Illumina, AWS and Google as well as National Sequencing Initiatives to explore genomics data sharing technologies.


## Who am I going to work with?

The team is inclusive and diverse, spans the whole range from biologists over bioinformaticians to software engineers, with junior and senior members. We collaborate with a number of international groups, e.g., the Broad Institute ( [Data Biosphere](https://medium.com/@benedictpaten/a-data-biosphere-for-biomedical-research-d212bbfae95d) ), Genomics England ( [National Initiatives](https://broadinstitute.swoogo.com/national-initiatives-2019/236753) ), and global initiatives such as the Global Alliance for Genomics Health ( [GA4GH](https://www.ga4gh.org/) ). This particular role will work in close collaboration with Illumina.

## Where are you located?

We are located in the heart of the [Melbourne Biomedical Precinct](https://www.melbournebiomed.com/) , with our office space in the [VCCC](https://www.viccompcancerctr.org/) â€“ join us and this could be the [view from your desk](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CiOHOayUUAEdG2D.jpg) . During the day you can enjoy a cup of coffee [on the terrace](https://plenarygroup.com/news-and-media/news/2016/parkvilles-new-rooftop-park-set-to-become-a-new-benchmark-for-melbourne) , or take a stroll around [Royal Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Park,_Melbourne) .

## Perks of the job?

Both roles come with 17% superannuation, and Melbourne University staff members have access to [extensive sports facilities](http://www.sport.unimelb.edu.au/fitnesscentres#Locations) and many [other benefits](https://about.unimelb.edu.au/careers/staff-benefits) .
