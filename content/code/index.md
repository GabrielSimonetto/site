The conduct is based on [Titus Brown's version](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/coc.html) (with his permission).

## Lab Code of Conduct

All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

### The Quick Version

The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions. 

### The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Oliver Hofmann immediately. If Oliver is the cause of your concern Tiffany Broughtwood (tiffany.boughtwood at mcri.edu.au) is a good informal point of contact; she does not work for Oliver or the University of Melbourne and has agreed to mediate. For official concerns you should get in touch with HR directly:

> The Inappropriate Workplace Behaviour Line http://mustaffcontactline.com.au/ is now available for employees to report inappropriate employee behaviour of unlawful discrimination, harassment, bullying, stalking, sexual assault, victimisation or vilification. Employees who experience or observe behaviours inconsistent with the [University's Appropriate Workplace Behaviour Policy](https://policy.unimelb.edu.au/MPF1328) should, in the first instance, contact their HR manager, or if this is not an option, contact the Inappropriate Workplace Behaviour Line on 1800 685 463. 

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event.
