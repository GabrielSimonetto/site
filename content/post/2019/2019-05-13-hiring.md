We have two exciting opportunities in our team:

* [Research Software Engineer](http://jobs.unimelb.edu.au/caw/en/job/899537/research-engineer) (PSC 8 - $103,409 -$111,927 p.a.)
* [Bioinformatician](http://jobs.unimelb.edu.au/caw/en/job/899782/bioinformatician-genomic-medicine), Genomic Medicine (PSC 8 - $103,409 -$111,927 p.a.)

## What would I be doing?

For the **Research Software Engineer position**, we are looking for someone to help us manage large volumes of genomics data in a clinical setting. This includes collaborations with academic and industry partners to develop and deploy infrastructure for handling genomic data. You would be asked to advise on resource requirements for current and future genomics data management, get involved in our migration to AWS and help us get a [handle on large scale genomic](https://github.com/elixir-europe/human-data-local-ega) data sets. You will have the opportunity to work with commercial partners at Illumina, AWS and Google as well as National Sequencing Initiatives to explore genomics data sharing technologies. 

For the **bioinformatics role**, we are looking for someone who will provide vital support to the [UoM Clinical Genomics Platform](https://research.unimelb.edu.au/centre-for-cancer-research/engage/services#clinical-genomics-platform). This means assisting with the sample workflow (tracking samples and working with the LIMS), providing quality control assessments of sequencing data and helping to troubleshoot. A keystone of the group is accreditation, this role includes responsibility for managing, analysing and interpreting genomic data for accreditation, with corresponding documentation. You would assist with analysing cancer genomics data, and producing reports to interpret, evaluate and compare data, using both HPC and cloud computing. The role would be ideal for someone interested in exploring large scale genomic data sets (see [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/623702v1) or [this poster](https://www.nygenome.org/bioinformatics/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BOG-poster-20194.pdf) for typical examples). The post would be suitable for someone seeking a part-time role.

## Who would I be working with?

The team is inclusive and diverse, spans the whole range from biologists over bioinformaticians to software engineers, with junior and senior members. We collaborate with a number of international groups, e.g., the Broad Institute ([Data Biosphere](https://medium.com/@benedictpaten/a-data-biosphere-for-biomedical-research-d212bbfae95d)), Genomics England ([National Initiatives](https://broadinstitute.swoogo.com/national-initiatives-2019/236753)), and global initiatives such as the Global Alliance for Genomics Health ([GA4GH](https://www.ga4gh.org/)).

## Where are the roles located?

We are located in the heart of the [Melbourne Biomedical Precinct](https://www.melbournebiomed.com/), with our office space in the [VCCC](https://www.viccompcancerctr.org/) -- join us and this could be the [view from your desk](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CiOHOayUUAEdG2D.jpg). During the day you can enjoy a cup of coffee [on the terrace](https://www.designinc.com.au/cms_uploads/images/611_vccc-4.jpg), or take a stroll around [Royal Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Park,_Melbourne). 

## Perks of the job?

Both roles come with 17% superannuation, and Melbourne University staff members have access to [extensive sports facilities](http://www.sport.unimelb.edu.au/fitnesscentres#Locations) and many [other benefits](https://about.unimelb.edu.au/careers/staff-benefits). We offer flexible working arrangements including working from home. Applications for part-time work are welcome!

## Tell me more!

Applications close June 2nd 2019. For further information contact Oliver at <oliver.hofmann@unimelb.edu.au> or via Twitter ([@fiamh](https://twitter.com/fiamh?lang=en)).
