We regularly have open positions, but even when we are not actively advertising we are interested in talking to you if the work we do is of interest to you. 

All positions that we offer are funded for three years and offer 17% superannuation. Working hours are flexible, and remote or part-time work can be negotiated. The University is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status.

If you are passionate about open source software development and establishing a genomics platform to change cancer patient care you should apply. Your responsibilities are flexible and depend on both your interests and expertise. You will be involved in rapid whole genome and transcriptome sequencing of cancer patients and we can offer a fantastic work environment.

## Opportunities

As part of the team you will work with national and international partners, focusing on best practices and reusing existing software and solutions. Here are just some of our current projects:

* help us migrate our data management capabilities to Amazon Web Services
* work with us porting [bcbio-nextgen](https://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), our HTS workflow system, to the [Common Workflow Language](https://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* * collaborate with our collaborators at Illumina, The Broad Institute and across the [Global Alliance for Genomics & Health](https://www.ga4gh.org/) (GA4GH) to define, implement and test [data processing and dissemination methods](https://github.com/ga4gh/wiki/wiki)
* coordinate with the European Bioinformatics Institute and the GA4GH's [Large Scale Genomics' team](https://github.com/ga4gh/large-scale-genomics-wiki/wiki) on the development of [Local EGA](https://localega.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* improve our whole genome and transcriptome workflows  

The Centre has established a Genomics Innovation Hub, a Melbourne Medical Precinct-wide initiative, which partners with leaders in the genomic technology industry to rapidly develop and deploy disruptive molecular profiling technologies best suited to decoding cancer samples for our local research community. We are exploring the use of linked reads such as [10X / Chromium](https://www.10xgenomics.com/) to improve structural variation detection and using single-cell technologies to study tumour evolution. Exploring how to best apply long read technologies is next on the list, courtesy of a local [Promethion](https://www.bioplatforms.com/australian-genome-research-facility-ltd/).
